# EF Advanced Bot
Extension built to help users dribble, steal, speed shot, and goalkeep!

1. Paste the 2 DLLs from zip to the dependencies folder of tanji.
2. Paste the speedshot (WAV File) in the dependencies folder of tanji as well. (DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE WAV)
2. Install the exe in tanji modules.
3. Open the extension
4. Select the POD that is played with by double clicking it
4. Click Activate
5. Select Set Coords and click the Middle of the field (Keep it checked)(This is IMPORTANT don't mess this up)
6. Defender/Blocker clicks anywhere beside you once you sit on pod it automatically turns off. (Click 1 to turn ON/OFF)
7. Smart passer is if you're sitting on chair and you click 5+ spaces away, it will only put ball there and wont follow it! Check if interested, I personally never turn this on because it is not needed.
8. Speed shot is a way to help you know when to shoot a speed shot. Before game starts check mark Speed Shot and roller yourself or any furni on a roller then it will start beeping. You need to shoot as soon as it beeps and the pod will roll quick on the roller. You need to get use to speed shoting but this helps you know when to shoot.
9. Gk bot (Goalkeeper bot) - (Click 2 to turn ON/OFF - This is instant, when its checked it means its on. You can also put the delay where 100 is. 0 = fastest)
10. Another option for goalkeeping bot is you can use the ESC key, when someone shoots on you, click Escape and it will click behind the roller that was shot on

Make sure to follow all these steps for the extension to function properly
